This is a rigorous development of Boolean Algebra based on Whitesitt (1961) who based his development on Huntington (1904).

Definitions
1. A binary operation * on a set M is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair (a,b) of elements of M a unique element c = a * b in M.
2. A binary operation * on a set of elements M is associative if and only if for every a, b, and c in M, a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c
3. A binary operation * on a set M is commutative if and only if for every a and b in M, a * b = b * a
4. if * and % are two binary operations on the same set M, * is distributive over % if and only if for every a, b, and c in M, a * (b % c) = (a * b) % (a * c)
5. An element e in a class M is an identity for the binary operation * if and only if a * e = e * a = a for every element a in M.

Huntington's Postulates

Definition. A class of elements B together with two binary operations (+) and (.) (where a . b will be written ab) is a Boolean algebra if and only if the following postulates hold:

P1. The operations (+) and (.) are commutative.
P2. There exist in B distinct identity elements 0 and 1 relative to the operations (+) and (.) respectively.
P3. Each operation is distributive over the other.
P4. For every a in B there exists an element a' in B such that a + a' = 1 and aa' = 0

Theorems

T1. Every statement or algebraic identity deducible from the postulates of Boolean algebra remains valid if the operations (+) and (.), and the identity elements 0 and 1 are interchanged throughout. (This theorem is known as the principle of duality).

Proof. The proof of this theorem follows at once from the symmetry of the posulates with respect fo the two operations and the two identities. That is, if one statement or algebraic expression is obtained from another by a single application of the principle of duality, the second is said to be the dual of the first. Thus, it is clear that the first is also the dual of the second.

T2. For every element a in a Boolean algebra B, a + a = a and aa = a

Proof. 	a = a + 0		by P2
	  = a + aa'		by P4
	  = (a + a)(a + a')	by P3
	  = (a + a)(1)		by P4
	  = a + a.		by P2

Similarly,
	a = a(1)		by P2
	  = a . (a + a')	by P4
	  = aa + aa' 		by P3
	  = aa + 0		by P4
	  = aa.	 		by P2

Note that the second proof is the dual of the first, as aa is the dual of a + a. This is the nature of duality and will hold for all theorems. Thus it is only necessary to prove one of each pair of theorems below.

T3. For each element a in a Boolean algebra B, a + 1 = 1 and a . 0 = 0

Proof.	1 = a + a'	      	by P4
	  = a + a'(1)		by P2
	  = (a + a')(a + 1)	by P3
	  = 1(a + 1)   	 	by P4
	  = a + 1.		by P2

Definitions
The circuit between any two terminals is either open, having infinite impedence, or closed, having zero impedence.

Let X take on one of two values (see note for differences in this interpretation and Shannon's):
X = 0 when the circuit is open and there is no potential for current to flow
X = 1 when the circuit is closed and there is a possibility of current flowing

Let . represent the series connection of two circuits (see figure 1)
Let + represent the parallel connection of two circuits (see figure 2)
Let ' represent the negation of a circuit

Addition and Multiplication (+ and .) are dual operations with respect to 0 and 1, that is, given any expression, a dual exists that can be developed by exchanging every . with +, + with ., 0 with 1, and 1 with 0.

Postulates
The postulates are shown in pairs to highlight their duality.

1a. 1 + 1 = 1

1a. 1 + 1 = 1, a closed circuit in parallel with a closed circuit is a closed circuit.
1b. 0 . 0 = 0, an open circuit in series with an open circuit is an open circuit.
2a. 0 . 1 = 1 . 0 = 0, an open circuit in series with a closed circuit in either order is an oepen circuit.
2b. 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1, a closed circuit in parallel with an open circuit in either order is a closed circuit.
3a. 1 . 1 = 1, a closed circuit in series with a closed circuit is a closed circuit.
3b. 0 + 0 = 0, an open circuit in parallel with an open circuit is an open circuit.

4. At any given time, X = 0, or X = 1, exclusively.
5. The negation of a circuit is an inversion of the circuit operation, it will be open if the circuit is originally closed and open if the circuit is originally closed.

The above postulates are sufficient to develop all of the theorems below.

Theorems
Any theorem in boolean algebra can be proved using perfect induction (verification of all possible cases) or using an algebraic proof built from the definitions, postulates, and other previously proven theorems.

t1a. x . y = y . x
t1b. x + y = y + x
t2a. x . (y . z) = (x . y) . z
t2b. x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
t3a. x + (y . z) = (x + y) . (x + z)
t3a. x . (y + z) = (x . y) + (x . z)
t4a. 0 + x = x
t4b. 1 . x = x
t5a. 0 . x = 0
t5b. 1 + x = 1
t6a. x . x' = 0
t6b. x + x' = 1
t7a. 1' = 0
t7b. 0' = 1
t8.  (x')' = x 
t9a. (X . Y . ...)' = X' + Y' + ...
t9b. (X + Y + ...)' = X' . Y' . ...

t10a. f(x1, x2, ..., xn) = x1 + f(1, x2, ..., xn) . x'1... gobbledegook 

Algebraic Proofs

t4a. 0 + x = x

x is either 0 or 1; p4
if x = 0 then 0 + 0 = 0; p3b
if x = 1 then 0 + 1 = 1; p2b

therefore 0 + x = x

Discussion
There is a perfect analogy between two value propositional calculus and that given above if the terms represent propositions that can be true (1) or false (0). Shannon works from E. V. Huntington's postulates of symbolic logic:

1. The class K contains at least two distinct elements.
2. If a and b are in the class K then a + b is in the class K.
3. a + b = b + a
4. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
5. a + a = a
6. ab + ab' = a

Symbol	Interpretation in circuits	Interpretation in Calculus
x	The circuit x  	  		The proposition x
0	The circuit is open		The proposition is false
1	The circuit is closed		The proposition is true
x + y	The parallel connection of x, y	The proposition which is true if either x or y is true
x . y	The series connection of x, y 	The proposition which is true if both x and y is true
x'  	The circuit open when x is  	The contradictory of proposition x
	closed, and closed when x is
	open
= 	The circuits open and close	Each proposition implies the other	
	simultaneously

Note: My read of his work seems to indicate that a modern interpretation requires that where Shannon used 0 we should use 1 and where he used plus, we should use multiplication (he looked at things from a hinderance perspective - 0, means no hindrance, which is a closed circuit, and 1, or unity, means complete hindrance, which is an open circuit, and he also saw addition as a series circuit and multiplication as a parallel circuit).
