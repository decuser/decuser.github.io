How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

This problem requires a strategy to ensure that it is tested properly. I think checking for boundary conditions is reasonable:
1. call with no file and CTRL-D (EOF)
2. empty file
3. characters and no nls
4. a single nl
5. characters and new lines, end with character
6. characters and new lines, end with nl
7. invisible characters included

```
vi ex1-11.c

/* ex1-11 test word count program
 * created 20180224.1907 */
#include <stdio.h>

#define IN 1	/* inside a word */
#define OUT 0	/* outside a word */

/* count lines, words, and characters in input */
int main()
{
	int c, nl, nw, nc, state;

	state = OUT;
	nl = nw = nc = 0;
	while((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
		++nc;
		if(c == '\n')
			++nl;
		if(c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
			state = OUT;
		else if(state == OUT) {
			state = IN;
			++nw;
		}
	}
	printf("\n%d %d %d\n", nl, nw, nc);
	return 0;
}

./a.out

printf "" | ./a.out

printf "abcde" | ./a.out 

0 1 5
printf "\n"  | ./a.out 

1 0 1
printf "ab cd e\n\na"  | ./a.out
