# Exercise 1-12
Write a program that prints its input one word per line

Words being the key idea here. In the text a word is a set of characters delimited by whitespace - specifically space, newline, or tab. I compressed whitespace and ignored empty lines.

```
/* ex1-12 one word per line
 * created 20180225.1549 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int inword = 0;
	int last_ws = 0;

	int c;

	while((c = getchar()) != EOF)
	{
		if(c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
		{
			if(last_ws == 0 && inword)
				printf("\n");
			inword = 0;
			last_ws = 1;
		}
		else
		{
			putchar(c);
			inword = 1;
			last_ws = 0;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}


printf "Now\n is the time   for         all good\t\t  men  \t  \n\nto come together\n" |./a.out 
Now
is
the
time
for
all
good
men
to
come
together
```

The programming logic of these examples is starting to get interesting enough that I may need to invest some time in learning lldb so that I can debug the programs without print statements :)
