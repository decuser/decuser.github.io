Today, I did my 50th deployment (this is the 51st) of the blog, adding mermaid-js support to the site. So, now I can add in flow diagrams and such as I explore fossil scm or other flowing stuff.

I hope you're finding the posts here interesting, useful, or fun. If you like, drop me a note and tell me what is needed, what's good, what needs to go. As always, please be constructive :).
