A video walking the user through the process of programming the PAL-1 using the keypad. It begins with a short overview of the PAL-1, then covers prelims like where the START program resides in ROM, how to set up the IRQ and NMI vectors, how to view the Accumulator contents, how to enter a program, where it should go, and how to run it normally and single step.

Enjoy!
