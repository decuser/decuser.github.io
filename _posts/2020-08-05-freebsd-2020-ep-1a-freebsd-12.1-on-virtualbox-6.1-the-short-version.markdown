A no-nonsense version of the previous tutorial to install FreeBSD 12.1 on VirtualBox 6.1. This version is less than half as long, leaving out most of the commentary and just performing the install. This installs FreeBSD with just a base install (console only), in preparation for future work such as installation of the gui and preparing for systems programming. 

Here's the [gist](https://gist.github.com/decuser/a083bd53770405c0485502e456322b6a) that goes along with this video.
