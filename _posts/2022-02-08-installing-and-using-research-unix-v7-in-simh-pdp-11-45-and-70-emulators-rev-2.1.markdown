It covers building a working v7 instance from tape files that will run on the SimH emulator. First, the reader will be led through the restoration of a pristine v7 instance from tape to disk. Next, the reader will be led through adding a regular user, making the system multi-user capable. Then, the reader will be shown how to make the system multi-session cable allowing multiple simultaneous sessions. Finally, the system will be put to use with hello world, DMR style, and the learn system will be enabled.
