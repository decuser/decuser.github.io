This is the first video in the Beginner's Guide to Learning Unix with FreeBSD 2021 series. In this video, I work through the process of installing a Unix learning system, FreeBSD, as a virtual system running on the user's existing platform (Mac, BSD, Linux, Windows, etc.) using the freely downloadable VirtualBox software.

I talk through every aspect of the process of installing, setting up, and logging into the new system at a level that a newbie or beginner can understand... not because I dumb anything down, but because I explain everything, making practically no assumptions beyond expecting the viewer to know how to use a computer to browse, download and open files, and install applications.
