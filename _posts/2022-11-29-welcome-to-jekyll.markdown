This Blog ranges over diverse technical topics such as Retrocomputing, Unix, and Programming

Over the coming weeks, I will be moving my blog posts over from blogspot to here. My reason for moving is apolitcal and is simply because I wanted more control over my content. With GitHub Pages, my content is my own and it is simple to create new posts. With blogspot, it was difficult to do backups and creating content was a pain as well. Here's hoping the transition will be relatively painless :).
