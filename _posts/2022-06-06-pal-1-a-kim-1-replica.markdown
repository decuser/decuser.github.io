A post about my very own working PAL-1. It's definitely up and running.

I recently obtained my very own PAL-1, a KIM-1 Replica Kit (found at [https://www.tindie.com/products/tkoak/pal-1-a-mos-6502-powered-computer-kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/tkoak/pal-1-a-mos-6502-powered-computer-kit))

The kit is amazing. After hours of soldering fun (pronounce the el as the British do for even more fun), and not a couple of questions on the google group ([https://groups.google.com/g/pal6502](https://groups.google.com/g/pal6502)), I got it working. 

I plan to post my notes online as it's a pretty niche kit and there isn't a huge amount of info online. As I organize the resources, I will post them on the blog, as well.

Here's what it looks like, put together, all soldered up nice and neat:

after reinserting the 6502 and 6532's in  the right direction, it worked beautifully:
