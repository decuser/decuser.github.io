After looking 'round for a rationally designed power wheel, I gave up... well, not really. I just decided to develop a rational power wheel.

For whatever reason, my mind demands that there be a rational process behind the "cheats" I use. When I first came across the power wheel, I thought to myself, all of my pain and suffering related to Ohm's Law is over :). Ha! Little did I know that it was just beginning.

As it turns out, there are hundreds of variations of THE power wheel and so far as I can tell, few, if any are more than a compilation of the 12 formulas for determining quantities of watts, amps, volts, and resistance given any two.

I tried to memorize the 12 formulas, but struggled to keep them in mind. So, I went off to try to memorize a power wheel to very little satisfaction.

That drove me to develop one that could be derived from very simple beginnings... in my case, an acronym and two mnemonics:

* **WIRE**

and

* **Where in Exile? Exiled in Rome!**
