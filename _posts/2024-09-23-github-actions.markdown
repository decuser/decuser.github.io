This post is not a particularly informative one, but when I tried to switch to github actions for publishing the blog, uh, it went poorly.

Maybe I'll try again later, but for the time being - sticking with publish a branch.

If you're lost reading this, no worries. It's github speak for if it ain't broke, don't fix it :).
