This is decuser's blog on GitHub. I am Will Senn and my nick on pretty much any social network I participate in is decuser. I chose it ages back as a nod to my first hand-me-down PC from my dad - a Digital Equipment (DEC) Rainbow Model 100 w/CPM and DOS. The Rainbow was the PC where I learned how computers worked and I remember it and my dad fondly.

This site contains my public facing notes on technology. These notes are based on my own technical explorations and adventures. I am an avid note-taker. Not because I like taking notes, but because I despise doing something twice and obtaining different outcomes. To ensure repeatability, I have found that taking detailed notes is essential and this drives me :). If the result of an exploration or adventure is interesting or if I think it might benefit someone down the road, I like to  post those notes. Sometimes, I polish up the notes and try to make them more reader friendly, but other times, not so much.

I have benefitted enormously from the information others have posted and think it is important to post what you learn to ease the journey of those who follow. I hope you find information here useful and interesting, but your mileage may vary.

Enjoy.
